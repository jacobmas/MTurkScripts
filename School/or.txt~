It is a policy of the State Board of Education and a priority of the
Oregon Department of Education that there will be no discrimination or
harassment on the grounds of race, color, sex, marital status, religion,
national origin, age, sexual orientation, or disability in any educational
programs, activities or employment. Persons having questions about
equal opportunity and nondiscrimination should contact the Director at
the Oregon Department of Education/255 Capitol St NE Salem, OR
97310/Phone: 503-947-5740/Fax: 503-378-4772
This directory is produced at least annually by the Communications office.
Revisions to the directory are solicited in May of each year, which allows
time for the directory to be compiled and posted on the web by early Fall.
The directory can be accessed on our website, www.oregon.gov/ODE.
MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR
Oregon has 197 school districts and more than 1,200 public and charter schools. As we work to streamline
education and improve the opportunities and outcomes for our students, building strong connections between
schools, districts and the broader community will be vital. The Oregon School Directory is a tool that I hope our
state will find helpful in making those contacts and building those important connections.
The Online Oregon School Directory is a compilation of phone numbers, addresses, emails, and key staff people
in all public schools and districts in the state, along with additional information about private schools, Oregon
Department of Education (ODE) staff contacts, and other educational institutions. For more information on ODE
staff organized by topic, please see our ODE YellowPages.
This directory is updated throughout the school year to ensure that you always have access to the latest contact
information for Oregon public schools and districts. However, contact information is only as good as it is current.
If you see out-of-date or inaccurate information for your school, please take the time to let us know by emailing
us at: ode.institutions-request@ode.state.or.us. If you have a major institution change such as adding or removing
institutions from our database, please complete this form and send it to the email address above. You can also use
the Institutions LookupTool on our website to check what information we have in our database for yourinstitution.
Thank you for helping us keep this tool as accurate and useful as possible.
